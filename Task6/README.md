what need to do?

MAIN :


1. Install Jenkins. It must be installed in a docker container.
2. Install necessary plugins (if you need).
3. Configure several (2-3) build agents. Agents must be run in docker.
4. Create a Freestyle project. Which will show the current date as a result of execution.
5. Create Pipeline which will execute docker ps -a in docker agent, running on Jenkins masterâ€™s Host.
6. Create Pipeline, which will build artefact using Dockerfile directly from your github repo (use Dockerfile from previous task).
7. Pass  variable PASSWORD=QWERTY! To the docker container. Variable must be encrypted!!!




How was it done?

1) Created AWS Instance ubuntu... installed docker on it... install docker image jenkins and run it...

After It I install plugins: Docker, Docker-API, Docker Pipeline

For connection to docker first i change docker.service config file "/lib/systemd/system/docker.service"  and add "ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H fd:// --containerd=/run/containerd/containerd.sock"

After it on jenkins GUI I add Cloud "docker"

after I added Docker agent Template... Configure it and Save it... so I created new job "test" for check if my agent work perfectly and here we go...

Now we should create freestyle job which will show us current time... so first we should add plugin called "Build timestamp" and configure it to GMT+4


so after we can create New freestyle job and build it...

Here we go... 

![alt text](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/by.bucket-exadel/T6-14.JPG)


So now we should create Pipeline...

![alt text](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/by.bucket-exadel/T6-20.JPG)

and build it... here we have Result

no we should create another pipeline and use dockerfile from our github...

![alt text](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/by.bucket-exadel/T6-18.JPG)

here is the result
